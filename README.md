## Note:
Dear reader,

This is simply a repository of some of the assignments I undertook during my time on the Master’s Programme: MSc Computational Finance, at UCL. It does not include those that required handwritten answers, as they would be far too specific and perhaps difficult to follow in places. In truth, I do not expect them to be of much interest to the average reader as some of them answer a set of questions which I have not provided – as it would be inappropriate to do so, I merely hope they will offer an idea of what is expected.

_Modules not included:_ Probability Theory & Stochastic Processes (COMP0045); Financial Engineering (COMP0048); Applied Computational Finance (COMP0041).
