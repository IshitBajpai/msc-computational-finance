A self contained review of the pricing of interest rate swaps across both traditional and decentralised finance. The pricing formulas for the traditional case are examined and two popular methodologies for curve construction––explicit and implicit interpolation of the discount factors––are implemented in Python using market data. One specific example of crypto interest rate swaps, the BitMEX Bitcoin-USD Funding Rate Swap, is discussed and its pricing formula examined. Our project concludes with some opportunities for new interest rate swap-like products within crypto markets.
