I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr.\ Carolyn Phelan and Mr.\ Benjamin Loveless for their patient support and guidance throughout this project. In addition, I would like to thank them for providing this opportunity in the first place. I also wish to thank Prof.\ Guido Germano, Dr.\ Silvia Bartolucci, and Dr.\ Riaz Ahmad for their teaching and support throughout this masterâ€™s programme. I found their modules particularly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable, and they served to motivate me for a career in Quantitative Finance.
